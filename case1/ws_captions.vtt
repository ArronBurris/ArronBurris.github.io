00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We observe today

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
not a victory of party,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but a celebration of freedom-

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
symbolizing an end,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
as well as a beginning-

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
signifying renewal,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
as well as change.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For I have sworn before you

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and Almighty God

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the same solemn oath

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.00
our forefears prescribed

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
nearly a century and three-quarters ago.
