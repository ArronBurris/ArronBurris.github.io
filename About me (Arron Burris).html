		About Arron
		</h2>
			<p>
			My name is Arron Burris, I live in Nixa MO, I graduated from Nixa High School last year and this is my second semester at OTC.
			</p>
			<p>
			My current degree at OTC is for Computer science, although I plan to switch focus over to software development when I transfer over to MSU after my second year here.
			I want to get into this field through college because it seems like a good skill to pair with my interest in art and animation.
			</p>
			<p>
			I really enjoy wasting my time with video games and trying to not waste my time by learning how to draw.</p>
