			<h1> 
			Who am I? 
			</h1>
				<p>
				My name is Arron Burris, I live in Nixa MO, I graduated from Nixa High School last year and this is my second semester at OTC.
				</p>
				<p>
				My current degree at OTC is for Computer science, although I plan to switch focus over to software development when I transfer over to MSU after my second year here.
				I want to get into this field through college because it seems like a good skill to pair with my interest in art and animation.
				</p>
				<p>
				I really enjoy wasting my time with video games and trying to not waste my time by learning how to draw.

			What I intend to do after college
			</h1>
				<p>
				After I finish up at OTC I intend to transfer over to MSU for two years in order to finish my 4 years to get my bachelors degree in software development.
				</p>
				<p>
				Although what I truly wish to do for a living is a bit more... out there. 
				</p>
				<p>
				What I truly want to do for a living is art and animation for some kind of large projects be it games or shows or what ever, I just wanna draw and animate.
